# T2MAT(Text-to-Material)


  A comprehensive framework processing from a user-input sentence, generating material structures aligning with goal properties beyond the existing database via globally exploring chemical space, followed by an entirely automated Density Functional Theory (DFT) validation workflow.

We have developed a new generative model——SymGEN. The symmetry(ratio of structures with non-P1 space group, Figure e), thermodynamic stability(DFT-calculated formation energies, Figure f) and kinetic stability(DFT-calculated phonon properties, Figure g) are significantly improved compared to the CDVAE. SymGEN will be replaced with the CDVAE in T2MAT after the manuscript of the SymGEN is submitted.
